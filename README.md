# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm.

## Description

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem involves finding the longest subsequence common to two given strings. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd Longest-Common-Subsequence-LCS
    ```

3.  Run the `lcs.py` script:

    ```bash
    python lcs.py
    ```
    the lcs.py file automatically reads test cases from test_cases.txt.

## Example

Input Strings:

-   `s1 = "ABCDGH"`
-   `s2 = "AEDFHR"`

Output:
